Problem 1: Name Organizer

Problem Statement:
    Write a Python program that asks the user to enter 5 names one by one and stores them in a list. Then:
    Sort the names alphabetically.
    Print the list of names.
    Ask the user to enter a name to search.
    Tell the user whether the name is in the list or not.

Example:

    Enter name 1: Riya
    Enter name 2: Aryan
    Enter name 3: Neha
    Enter name 4: Kabir
    Enter name 5: Zara

    Sorted names: ['Aryan', 'Kabir', 'Neha', 'Riya', 'Zara']

    Enter a name to search: Neha
    Neha is in the list!

Problem 2: Word Scrambler Game

Problem Statement:
    Write a Python program that scrambles a word and asks the user to guess the original word.
    Store any 3 words in a list (e.g. "apple", "banana", "grape").
    Pick one at random.
    Scramble its letters (e.g. "grape" â†’ "argpe").
    Show the scrambled word to the user and let them guess.
    Tell them if they guessed it right or not.

Example:

    Guess the word: nagaba
    Your guess: banana
    Correct!

    Guess the word: pplea
    Your guess: apple
    Correct!

Hints:

    Use random.choice() to pick a word.
    Use random.shuffle() on a list of letters.
    Use ''.join() to convert list back to a word.
