Problem 1: Lucky Number Checker

Problem Statement:
    Write a Python program that asks the user to enter a number. The program should check if the number is a "lucky number". A number is considered lucky if:

    - It is divisible by 7 or
    - The sum of its digits is 7

Example:

    Input: 33
    Output: Not a lucky number

    Input: 16
    Output: Lucky number! (1 + 6 = 7)

    Input: 21
    Output: Lucky number! (divisible by 7)

Hints:

    - Use input() to take input from the user.
    - Use % to check divisibility.
    - Use a loop or str() to get each digit and find the sum.

Problem 2: Build a Simple Quiz

Problem Statement:
    Create a simple 3-question quiz program. The program should:
    Ask the user 3 questions (you can hard-code the questions).
    Keep track of how many answers are correct.
    Show the final score out of 3 at the end.

Example:

    Q1: What is the capital of India? 
    Your answer: Delhi
    Correct!

    Q2: What is 5 x 6?
    Your answer: 30
    Correct!

    Q3: What color do you get when you mix red and yellow?
    Your answer: Orange
    Correct!

    Your final score is: 3/3

Hints:

    - Use input() to ask questions.
    - Use if statements to compare answers.
    - Keep a variable like score = 0 and increase it when the answer is right.
