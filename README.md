# Python Learning and Projects Workspace

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts, assignments, and resources for learning Python programming and experimenting with various concepts. The workspace is organized for both beginners and intermediate learners, with examples, assignments, and mini-projects.

## Structure

- **Assignments**: Problem statements and solutions for practice ([Assignment1.md](Assignment1.md), [Assignment2.md](PythonTutorial/Assignment2.md))
- **Python Scripts**: Example scripts covering data types, functions, file operations, games, and more (e.g., [calculator.py](calculator.py), [guessNumber.py](guessNumber.py), [palindrome.py](palindrome.py))
- **Mini Projects**: Small projects like To-Do List, Payment Orchestration, PDF Extraction, and Games ([to_do.py](to_do.py), [payment.py](payment.py), [pdfExtractor.py](pdfExtractor.py), [RockPaperScissor.py](RockPaperScissor.py))
- **File Operations**: Examples of reading, writing, and manipulating files ([FileOps/OpsTest.py](FileOps/OpsTest.py), [FileOps/FileOps.py](FileOps/FileOps.py))
- **Visualization**: Manim-based animation scripts for diagrams and flows ([animate/flow.py](animate/flow.py), [animate/sequence.py](animate/sequence.py))
- **Resources**: Supporting files like PDFs, Excel plans, and images.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd <repo-folder>
   ```

2. **Install requirements**  
   Some scripts require external libraries. Install them using:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Create a `requirements.txt` if needed, e.g., for `PyPDF2`, `scikit-learn`, `manim`, etc.)*

3. **Run Python scripts**  
   ```sh
   python script_name.py
   ```

4. **Assignments**  
   - Read the assignment markdown files for problem statements.
   - Implement your solutions in new or existing `.py` files.

## Notable Scripts

- **Games**: [guessNumber.py](guessNumber.py), [RockPaperScissor.py](RockPaperScissor.py), [diceProgram.py
